I remember the first season of Sacred Games very fondly. Living in London at the time, it was a refreshing change to hear Nawaz and Saif cuss their way through eight hours of dark and delightful television. In Hindi. The off-handed familiar (and familial) swear words thrown into regular sentences, like peanuts in Poha, made me nostalgic for home. 

And this wasn't just some perverse delight I had grown into, having grown-up in North India. My best friend, an hour away in Cambridge, shared the same excitement and enthusiasm about hearing Saif Ali Khan answer phone calls with a foul mouth. And he had exchanged India for England when he was 11.

So when Season 2 dropped this year, I was excited to share this nostalgia once again. But my best friend was now over 8 hours in flights away, and nearing a hectic end of a first year of PhD. I had no choice but to text him the hilarious captions that filled in the occasional silences - in an attempt to lure him into the seedy underbelly of Indian Netflix.

## Season 1
I dont know how anyone keeps up with plots anymore. Coming on the heels of an exciting year in TV - Killing Eve, Derry Girls, Bojack Horseman - I would have been lost without a rewatch of Season 1.

<p>Some captions maintained continuity across episodes.</p>

## Season 2
A day later than planned, but this season didn't disappoint either. The screenwriters at Netflix (yes thats what I call them) moved on from silences, to adding subtext to actual conversations.

<p>But soon they were back to what they do best.</p>

<p>
For what they are, these screenwriters are pretty good. After all, they are in competition with real gems like this one.
